# Word Contextualisation with Fine-Tuned State-of-the-Art Transformers
Building Semantic Surroundings for Advanced Vocabulary

Welcome to the Word Contextualization Generator project! This initiative focuses on fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-2, Llama2, and Gemma-2b to generate contextually relevant and linguistically coherent word usage examples in the field of astronomy. By leveraging a custom dataset of 30 vocabulary words and their usage instances, we aim to enhance the models' ability to produce domain-specific text. The project includes detailed steps for data preparation, model selection, fine-tuning, and evaluation using advanced metrics like chrF++. Our goal is to push the boundaries of automated text generation in specialized domains, providing valuable insights into the customization of LLMs for precise and contextually appropriate applications.

### Example Usecase


```Instruction: What is the usage of the word 'abound' in the context of astronomy?```

```pre-trained llm```
```
Response:
'Abundance' refers to the relative amount of a particular element or other property.

'Abundance' is used in the context of astronomy to mean 'a large amount of a specific chemical element or compound'.
Abundance is used to describe the concentration of elements in the universe as a whole, and is a useful measure of the relative amount of a given element or compound in the cosmos.
Abundance of a specific element in the Universe is determined by a number of factors, including the initial conditions of the universe, the rate of chemical reactions and the rate of cosmic ray bombardment.
The abundance of a specific element or compound can be used to infer the age and history of the Universe.
The abundance of a given chemical element can also be used to infer the presence of life on Earth or other planets.
The abundance of a chemical element can be determined by analyzing a sample of the substance or by measuring the ratio of the abundance of a given element to that of a standard element.

Abundance is the amount of a particular element or compound in a sample of a substance.
Abundance can be determined by analyzing a sample of
